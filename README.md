# ms-demo-gen(MSDGen)
MSDGen is a microservice demo generator of any given scale of service number and connection.
It finally creates k8s manifests in a yaml file and topology data in a DOT file from which 
you can get an image through graphviz.

The aim of MSDGen is to build large scale microservcie projects to test service mesh frameworks like Istio.
